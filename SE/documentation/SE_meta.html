<h2>Methodological Appendix: Sweden</h2>

<p>
For Sweden, I compile a comprehensive panel of housing statistics using register-based data from Statistics Sweden (SCB).
All datasets are extracted through the SCB <em>Statistikdatabasen</em> interface and cover the full set of
<strong>290 municipalities</strong>. The primary variables include the number of dwellings, their characteristics
(type of building, size, period of construction), the distribution of residential and non-residential floor space, income data at the municipal level, house prices and rents.
</p>

<p>
For the price data, information is collected directly from the source website at the municipal level 
(<a href="https://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/housing-construction-and-building/real-estate/real-estate-prices-and-registrations-of-title/pong/tables-and-graphs/statistics-for-municipalities/average-prices-for-one--and-two-dwelling-buildings-2024-by-municipality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistics Sweden</a>). 
The dataset includes the municipality code and name, the number of purchases, the average transaction price 
(expressed in SEK thousands), and percentage changes in prices over multiple horizons: one year (2023&ndash;2024), 
five years (2019&ndash;2024), ten years (2014&ndash;2024), and twenty years (2004&ndash;2024). To obtain a complete time series, the missing year is interpolated 
using regional House Price Indices (HPI), including indices for the main cities. In addition, linear interpolation 
is applied to ensure consistency and to construct a smooth municipal-level price time series.
